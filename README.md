# Index-Creator

+ This project creates an index that is similar to a **text book index in that it contains terms and page numbers**. 
+ It uses a text and a list of terms that need to be indexed to produce an **alphabetical index**.
+ This project was inspired by problem 5.2.11 from the book :blue_book: *"Data Structures using C and C++" by Langsam, Augenstein, and Tenenbaum*. 
+ I've used and implemented **AVL trees and Tries** as my data structures.
+ To create this project, I drew on concepts from both generic programming and object-oriented programming. 
+ The **process** for creating the index is as follows 
    1. All *special characters* from the text, including $,%,!, and others, were removed using simple tests of ASCII values.
    2. All *stop words* like and, or, not, why, if, â€¦ were eliminated. While traversing each word from the file acquired in the output of step one, if a word was found in a trie of stop words, it was discarded.
    3. The output file from phase 2 is the file being processed in this step. Every word is scanned, and if it is discovered in a trie of terms, it is added to one AVL tree, and the its page number is added to another. The *AVL tree of terms and page numbers* are connected.
    4. The resultant AVL trees are *traversed in-order* to produce the index.
