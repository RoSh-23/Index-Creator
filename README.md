# Index-Creator

<br>This project creates an index that is similar to a text book index in that it contains terms and page numbers. <br>
It uses a text and a list of terms that need to be indexed to produce an alphabetical index. <br>
This project was inspired by problem 5.2.11 from the book "Data Structures using C and C++" by Langsam, Augenstein, and Tenenbaum. <br>
I've used and implemented AVL trees and Tries as my data structures. <br>
To create this project, I drew on concepts from both generic programming and object-oriented programming. <br>
<br>
The process for creating the index is as follows
